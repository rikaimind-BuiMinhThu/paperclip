# remap-only condition dropped privileges onto an unwritable home and the

# over the WHOLE tree (uid and gid): a root-owned mount or descendant
# (init containers, backup restores, files written before a remap) is
# found immediately and repaired recursively, a GID-only remap is caught,
# and a fully-correct tree costs one metadata-only walk with no chown.
